# Welcome to PwnShop
PwnShop is a series of workshops where I teach people the introduction to Pwn!
Feel free to use these challenges and material for teaching yourself and others binary exploitation.
The actual Pwnshops will be held at Aarhus University, Denmark under the local hacker club 0-Day Aarhus.
For each PwnShop there will be a video recording where the core concepts as well as chosen challenges are shown.

### Chapters
If you are new to pwn and only just heard the terms "pwntools" and "gdb/pwndbg" I would recommend that you start from chapter one.
The difficulty will increase with each of the chapters but each chapter is also marked with our own difficulty scale.

Best regards,
Cl1nical - 0-Day Aarhus
